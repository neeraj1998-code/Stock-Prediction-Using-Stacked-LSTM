# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM and Decision Trees




# Project Title:
Stock Price Prediction Using Stacked LSTM

# Overview:
Stock values are very valuable but extremely hard to predict correctly for any human being on their own. This project seeks to solve the problem of Stock Prices Prediction by utilizing Deep Learning models, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network algorithms, to predict future stock values.  Historical data about the stock values that have been publicly listed by Yahoo-Finance has been used in this project and I have used the stock value data of ‘Reliance Multinational’. This can be considered as a Time series analysis is a specialized branch of statistics used extensively in fields such as Econometrics & Operation Research. This is a specifically designed time series problem for you and the challenge is to forecast traffic.


# Aim/Objective:
In the past decades, there has been an increasing interest in predicting markets among economists, policymakers, academics, and market makers. The objective of the proposed work is to study and improve the supervised learning algorithms to predict the stock price.


# Technical Objective:
The technical objectives will be implemented in Python. The system must be able to access a list of historical prices. It must calculate the estimated price of a stock based on historical data for the next 30 days. It must also provide a quick visualization of the market index in a neatly formatted Python-Based Web App.
